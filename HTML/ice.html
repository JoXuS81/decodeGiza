                                        In the second half of the XX century, started to emerge enormous global changes in way how we communicate, collect information and make our lives more fun. It started with shy â€“ we had gigantic calculate tools, and just the largest companies in the world, possesed some of these machines. Today, we know that NASA for flight to the Moon, used in their Apollo (Saturn) rockets, very rudimentary machines, which are compared to modern computers, just drop in the technological ocean.

                                        In 1980s, Commodore company published on the market two computer models, which will later make skyrocketing success. I am talking about Commodore 64 and Amiga (particularly Amiga 500) models. Commodore 64 was a long time the most popular computer model in the world, and from 1987, Amiga has taken a leader position. Amiga 500 was equipped with fantastic graphic possibilities for that time, and even with better graphic was model Amiga 1200. However, none of these models, couldn't keep leader position in computer world, and they became part of history. Actually, all of these models surrended in match with PC. Until today, PC has a total advantage in computer industry. I can say that we are witnesses of the super fast development of the computer world in all of these years.
